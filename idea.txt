Your project is well-structured and covers the full workflow: script generation, video creation, caption/hashtag suggestion, and platform upload. Here are some **potential gaps or new features** you could consider:

### 1. **Analytics & Performance Tracking**
- Track engagement metrics (likes, views, shares) for uploaded videos.
- Show analytics dashboard in Streamlit for past uploads.

### 2. **Content Calendar & Scheduling**
- Allow users to schedule posts for future dates/times.
- Integrate with platform APIs for scheduled uploads.

### 3. **Template Library**
- Provide reusable script/video templates for common product types.

### 4. **Multi-language Support**
- Expand language options beyond English/Hindi.
- Auto-translate captions/scripts.

### 5. **A/B Testing**
- Generate multiple versions of scripts/captions and track which performs best.

### 6. **User Authentication & History**
- Let users log in and view/download their previous content.
- Save project history for re-use.

### 7. **Image/Video Editing Tools**
- Add basic editing (crop, trim, filters) for uploaded media.

### 8. **Trend Analysis**
- Suggest trending hashtags/topics based on real-time data.

### 9. **Collaboration**
- Allow multiple users to collaborate on content creation.
